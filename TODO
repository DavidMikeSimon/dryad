- Allow optional use of a catious mode which:
  - Makes sure all attribute keys are valid in XML
  - Makes sure all tags are valid in XML
  - In the HTML taglib, checks attributes for tag-specific validity
  - Does not cause a performance hit if not in use (use OOP, not lots of ifs)
- NoSuchTagException should suggest similarly-named tags to counteract spelling errors
