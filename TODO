- Allow optional use of a catious mode which:
  - Makes sure all attribute keys are valid in XML
  - Makes sure all tags are valid in XML
  - In the HTML taglib, checks attributes for tag-specific validity
  - Disallows tag definitions that end with question marks or bangs or mask built-in methods
  - Does not cause a performance hit if not in use (use OOP, not lots of ifs)
  - Flag attempts to use tag return values with helpful error messages
- Add methods like dryml's before, after, prepend, append stuff, which check against tag name and class
- Don't have tag definitions take arguments anymore; have them retrieve stuff via methods in DocumentBuilder
  - Implies that tag definitions can't be done with regular "def" anymore
- Add a specialize method that takes a tag name and block, letting you do a one-time derivation of that tag and output
  it right away
- Have all tags return nil (so that attempts to use tag return values cause errors)
