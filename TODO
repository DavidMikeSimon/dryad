- Allow optional use of a catious mode which:
  - Makes sure all attribute keys are valid in XML
  - Makes sure all tags are valid in XML
  - In the HTML taglib, checks attributes for tag-specific validity
  - Does not cause a performance hit if not in use (use monkey-patches, not lots of ifs)
  - Flags attempts to use tag return values with helpful error messages
  - Maintains callstack through the recording/playback process
- Add methods like dryml's before, after, prepend, append stuff, which check against tag name and class
- Have all tags return nil (so that attempts to use tag return values cause errors)
- Prevent AttributesHash from being modified in place after being setup
- Consider freezing instance variables in sub contexts
- Consider executing statements immediately instead of recording when not in tag def block
  - This will be handy later when other things have def-like semantics (i.e. prepend and append)
