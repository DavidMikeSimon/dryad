- Allow optional use of a catious mode which:
  - Makes sure all attribute keys are valid in XML
  - Makes sure all tags are valid in XML
  - In the HTML taglib, checks attributes for tag-specific validity
  - Flags attempts to use tag return values with helpful error messages
  - Does not cause a performance hit if not in use (use monkey-patches, not lots of ifs)
  - Marks ActiveRecord instances in the instance variables as readonly
- Add methods like dryml's before, after, prepend, append stuff, which check against tag name and class
- Have all tags return nil (so that attempts to use tag return values cause errors)
- Prevent AttributesHash from being modified in place after being setup
- Consider freezing instance variables in sub contexts
- Don't set @io until after tag libraries loaded, complain usefully if anything tries to write before then
- Test that one tag-defining module can depend on another, and that including the base manually after that won't
  overwrite the child definitions
